# SalesAnalysis_SQL_PowerBI

### Setup
- This project necessitates the use of SQL Server (specifically, SQL Express) and Power BI Desktop.

- The primary objective of this project is to conduct a comparative analysis of structured and unstructured data. Our focus will be on examining information from the Data Warehouse (DW).
- To update the Data Warehouse data, you can use the provided [sql script.](https://github.com/techtalkcorner/SampleDemoFiles/blob/master/Database/AdventureWorks/Update_AdventureWorksDW_Data.sql)

### Business Request & User Stories
- Examine the provided sample business request, demand overview, and completed user stories to understand the problem we aim to address through data analysis and our proposed solution.

### Data Cleaning with T-SQL
- Distinguish between FACT tables and Dimension tables to gain a better understanding.
- Identify the tables within the dataset that align with the objectives outlined in the Business Request form.
- Choose the relevant columns for export using SQL techniques, such as column renaming, merging, SQL script annotations, statement formatting, WHERE clauses, ORDER BY clauses, LEFT JOIN operations, CASE() functions, and ISNULL() functions.
