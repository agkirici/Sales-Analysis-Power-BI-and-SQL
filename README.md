### Business Request & User Stories
- Review the provided sample business request, demand overview, and completed user stories to gain insights into the problem we aim to address through data analysis and our proposed solution.

### Clean the Data using T-SQL
- Understand the difference between FACT tables & Dimension tables.
- Identify which tables in the data are of interest with the help of the Business Request form.
- Choose which columns are of interest to export by preparing and transforming these columns in SQL using concepts such as: renaming columns, combining columns, commenting in SQL script, formatting of SQL statements, WHERE clause, ORDER BY, LEFT JOIN, CASE() function and ISNULL() function.
